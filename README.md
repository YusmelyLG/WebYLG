:writing_hand: I am in the design stage of this project. 
This portal allows you to easily access my media content in just one place. In just one menu, you can scroll to my recent YouTube videos, YouTube Shorts. Access written articles and listen to my Podcast. 
It will give access to a photo library. You will also be able to leave comments and chat with me. 

## Motivation
:writing_hand: I recently started a YouTube channel. Many of my followers have limited internet connection which makes it difficult to navigate the different social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, even my webpage. So, I thought that having a portal with all the information will be an easier and faster way to access all my content.  

## Built With
:writing_hand: - HTML - CSS - JavaScript
